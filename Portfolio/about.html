The shift to a new country came with its own set of challenges, particularly in adjusting to a new language and lifestyle. However, this experience has proven invaluable, teaching me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of cultural exchange.</p> <!-- About text detailing personal background -->
        <p class="about-description">Since 2020, I've been working part-time as a delivery driver. This role has not only helped me acclimate to the city but has also honed my organizational and time-management skills. Navigating busy streets and managing multiple deliveries each day has deepened my understanding of logistics and efficiency, which I believe will benefit me in my future career.</p> <!-- About text detailing work experience -->
